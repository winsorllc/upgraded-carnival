Your mission is to perform a deep architectural review and overhaul of the following media skills in .pi/skills/: ffmpeg-tools, video-frames, youtube-transcript, transcribe, camsnap, and image-gen. For each skill: 1) Read the existing SKILL.md and implementation code. 2) Rewrite the code to be strictly production-grade (add thorough error handling, progress indicators, edge-case coverage). 3) Update the SKILL.md to be extremely comprehensive (like your standard Architect work). Do NOT stop until all 6 skills are upgraded. Then, send a detailed email to winsorllc@yahoo.com explaining the specific improvements you made to each skill.
