Scan https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw, https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw, and https://github.com/stephengpope/thepopebot for new tools, skills, and architectures. Implement AS MANY new ideas as you can as PopeBot skills in your sandbox (.pi/skills/). For EACH skill: create the SKILL.md, write the implementation code, and write and run a test to prove it works. Do not stop at one skill — keep going until you run out of good ideas or time. After you have built and tested everything, use the send_email tool to email winsorllc@yahoo.com a comprehensive progress report listing every skill you built, your test results for each, and code samples.
