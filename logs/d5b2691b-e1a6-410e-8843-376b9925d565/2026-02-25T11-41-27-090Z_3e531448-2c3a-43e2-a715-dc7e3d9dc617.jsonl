Use when you need to interact with web pages, test frontends, or when user interaction with a visible browser is required.\n---\n\n# Browser Tools\n\nChrome DevTools Protocol tools for agent-assisted web automation. These tools connect to Chrome running on `:9222` with remote debugging enabled.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun once before first use:\n\n```bash\ncd {baseDir}/browser-tools\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Start Chrome\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-start.js              # Fresh profile\n{baseDir}/browser-start.js --profile    # Copy user's profile (cookies, logins)\n```\n\nLaunch Chrome with remote debugging on `:9222`. Use `--profile` to preserve user's authentication state.\n\n## Navigate\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-nav.js https://example.com\n{baseDir}/browser-nav.js https://example.com --new\n```\n\nNavigate to URLs. Use `--new` flag to open in a new tab instead of reusing current tab.\n\n## Evaluate JavaScript\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-eval.js 'document.title'\n{baseDir}/browser-eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll(\"a\").length'\n```\n\nExecute JavaScript in the active tab. Code runs in async context. Use this to extract data, inspect page state, or perform DOM operations programmatically.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-screenshot.js\n```\n\nCapture current viewport and return temporary file path. Use this to visually inspect page state or verify UI changes.\n\n## Pick Elements\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-pick.js \"Click the submit button\"\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use this tool when the user wants to select specific DOM elements on the page. This launches an interactive picker that lets the user click elements to select them. The user can select multiple elements (Cmd/Ctrl+Click) and press Enter when done. The tool returns CSS selectors for the selected elements.\n\nCommon use cases:\n- User says \"I want to click that button\" → Use this tool to let them select it\n- User says \"extract data from these items\" → Use this tool to let them select the elements\n- When you need specific selectors but the page structure is complex or ambiguous\n\n## Cookies\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-cookies.js\n```\n\nDisplay all cookies for the current tab including domain, path, httpOnly, and secure flags. Use this to debug authentication issues or inspect session state.\n\n## Extract Page Content\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/browser-content.js https://example.com\n```\n\nNavigate to a URL and extract readable content as markdown. Uses Mozilla Readability for article extraction and Turndown for HTML-to-markdown conversion. Works on pages with JavaScript content (waits for page to load).\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Testing frontend code in a real browser\n- Interacting with pages that require JavaScript\n- When user needs to visually see or interact with a page\n- Debugging authentication or session issues\n- Scraping dynamic content that requires JS execution\n\n---\n\n## Efficiency Guide\n\n### DOM Inspection Over Screenshots\n\n**Don't** take screenshots to see page state. **Do** parse the DOM directly:\n\n```javascript\n// Get page structure\ndocument.body.innerHTML.slice(0, 5000)\n\n// Find interactive elements\nArray.from(document.querySelectorAll('button, input, [role=\"button\"]')).map(e => ({\n  id: e.id,\n  text: e.textContent.trim(),\n  class: e.className\n}))\n```\n\n### Complex Scripts in Single Calls\n\nWrap everything in an IIFE to run multi-statement code:\n\n```javascript\n(function() {\n  // Multiple operations\n  const data = document.querySelector('#target').textContent;\n  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');\n  \n  // Interactions\n  buttons[0].click();\n  \n  // Return results\n  return JSON.stringify({ data, buttonCount: buttons.length });\n})()\n```\n\n### Batch Interactions\n\n**Don't** make separate calls for each click. **Do** batch them:\n\n```javascript\n(function() {\n  const actions = [\"btn1\", \"btn2\", \"btn3\"];\n  actions.forEach(id => document.getElementById(id).click());\n  return \"Done\";\n})()\n```\n\n### Typing/Input Sequences\n\n```javascript\n(function() {\n  const text = \"HELLO\";\n  for (const char of text) {\n    document.getElementById(\"key-\" + char).click();\n  }\n  document.getElementById(\"submit\").click();\n  return \"Submitted: \" + text;\n})()\n```\n\n### Reading App/Game State\n\nExtract structured state in one call:\n\n```javascript\n(function() {\n  const state = {\n    score: document.querySelector('.score')?.textContent,\n    status: document.querySelector('.status')?.className,\n    items: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.item')).map(el => ({\n      text: el.textContent,\n      active: el.classList.contains('active')\n    }))\n  };\n  return JSON.stringify(state, null, 2);\n})()\n```\n\n### Waiting for Updates\n\nIf DOM updates after actions, add a small delay with bash:\n\n```bash\nsleep 0.5 && {baseDir}/browser-eval.js '...'\n```\n\n### Investigate Before Interacting\n\nAlways start by understanding the page structure:\n\n```javascript\n(function() {\n  return {\n    title: document.title,\n    forms: document.forms.length,\n    buttons: document.querySelectorAll('button').length,\n    inputs: document.querySelectorAll('input').length,\n    mainContent: document.body.innerHTML.slice(0, 3000)\n  };\n})()\n```\n\nThen target specific elements based on what you find.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772019698232}}

What You Are\n\nYou are **thepopebot**, an autonomous AI agent running inside a Docker container.\n- You have full access to the machine and anything it can do to get the job done.\n\n### Directive: Overcoming Blockers & Creativity\nBecause you run totally autonomously (often for hours) without human intervention, it is critical that you **DO NOT GET STUCK**. \n- If you encounter an error trying to build or implement a tool, **do not give up.**\n- Pivot immediately. Try an alternative library, a different architecture, or a completely different language.\n- Be highly creative. If a problem seems too hard, break it down or accomplish the intention via a different route.\n- Never loop endlessly. If an approach fails 3 times, you MUST definitively abandon that approach and try a different one.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Local Docker Environment Reference\n\nThis section tells you where things about your operating container enviornment.\n\n### WORKDIR\n\nYour working dir WORKDIR=`/job` — this is the root folder for the agent.\n\nSo you can assume that:\n- /folder/file.ext is /job/folder/file.txt\n- folder/file.ext is /job/folder/file.txt (missing /)\n\n### Where Temporary Files Go `/job/tmp/`\n\n**Important:** Temporary files are defined as files that you create (that are NOT part of the final job.md deliverables)\n\n**Always** use `/job/tmp/` for any temporary files you create.\n\nScripts in `/job/tmp/` can use `__dirname`-relative paths (e.g., `../docs/data.json`) to reference repo files, because they're inside the repo tree. The `.gitignore` excludes `tmp/` so nothing in this directory gets committed.\n\nCurrent datetime: {{datetime}}"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772019698234}}

OpenClaw requires Node.js runtime (typically ~390MB additional memory overhead), while NanoBot requires Python runtime. PicoClaw and ZeroClaw are static binaries. The RAM figures above are runtime memory; build-time compilation requirements are higher.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"zero-claw.jpeg\" alt=\"ZeroClaw vs OpenClaw Comparison\" width=\"800\" />\n</p>\n\n### Reproducible local measurement\n\nBenchmark claims can drift as code and toolchains evolve, so always measure your current build locally:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --release\nls -lh target/release/zeroclaw\n\n/usr/bin/time -l target/release/zeroclaw --help\n/usr/bin/time -l target/release/zeroclaw status\n```\n\nExample sample (macOS arm64, measured on February 18, 2026):\n\n- Release binary size: `8.8MB`\n- `zeroclaw --help`: about `0.02s` real time, ~`3.9MB` peak memory footprint\n- `zeroclaw status`: about `0.01s` real time, ~`4.1MB` peak memory footprint\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\n#### Required\n\n1. **Visual Studio Build Tools** (provides the MSVC linker and Windows SDK):\n\n    ```powershell\n    winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools\n    ```\n\n    During installation (or via the Visual Studio Installer), select the **\"Desktop development with C++\"** workload.\n\n2. **Rust toolchain:**\n\n    ```powershell\n    winget install Rustlang.Rustup\n    ```\n\n    After installation, open a new terminal and run `rustup default stable` to ensure the stable toolchain is active.\n\n3. **Verify** both are working:\n    ```powershell\n    rustc --version\n    cargo --version\n    ```\n\n#### Optional\n\n- **Docker Desktop** — required only if using the [Docker sandboxed runtime](#runtime-support-current) (`runtime.kind = \"docker\"`). Install via `winget install Docker.DockerDesktop`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Linux / macOS</strong></summary>\n\n#### Required\n\n1. **Build essentials:**\n    - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config`\n    - **Linux (Fedora/RHEL):** `sudo dnf group install development-tools && sudo dnf install pkg-config`\n    - **macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n\n2. **Rust toolchain:**\n\n    ```bash\n    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n    ```\n\n    See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for details.\n\n3. **Verify** both are working:\n    ```bash\n    rustc --version\n    cargo --version\n    ```\n\n#### One-Line Installer\n\nOr skip the steps above and install everything (system deps, Rust, ZeroClaw) in a single command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n#### Compilation resource requirements\n\nBuilding from source needs more resources than running the resulting binary:\n\n| Resource       | Minimum | Recommended |\n| -------------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| **RAM + swap** | 2 GB    | 4 GB+       |\n| **Free disk**  | 6 GB    | 10 GB+      |\n\nIf your host is below the minimum, use pre-built binaries:\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap.sh --prefer-prebuilt\n```\n\nTo require binary-only install with no source fallback:\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap.sh --prebuilt-only\n```\n\n#### Optional\n\n- **Docker** — required only if using the [Docker sandboxed runtime](#runtime-support-current) (`runtime.kind = \"docker\"`). Install via your package manager or [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n> **Note:** The default `cargo build --release` uses `codegen-units=1` to lower peak compile pressure. For faster builds on powerful machines, use `cargo build --profile release-fast`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Homebrew (macOS/Linuxbrew)\n\n```bash\nbrew install zeroclaw\n```\n\n### One-click bootstrap\n\n```bash\n# Recommended: clone then run local bootstrap script\ngit clone https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw.git\ncd zeroclaw\n./bootstrap.sh\n\n# Optional: bootstrap dependencies + Rust on fresh machines\n./bootstrap.sh --install-system-deps --install-rust\n\n# Optional: pre-built binary first (recommended on low-RAM/low-disk hosts)\n./bootstrap.sh --prefer-prebuilt\n\n# Optional: binary-only install (no source build fallback)\n./bootstrap.sh --prebuilt-only\n\n# Optional: run onboarding in the same flow\n./bootstrap.sh --onboard --api-key \"sk-...\" --provider openrouter [--model \"openrouter/auto\"]\n\n# Optional: run bootstrap + onboarding fully in Docker-compatible mode\n./bootstrap.sh --docker\n\n# Optional: force Podman as container CLI\nZEROCLAW_CONTAINER_CLI=podman ./bootstrap.sh --docker\n\n# Optional: in --docker mode, skip local image build and use local tag or pull fallback image\n./bootstrap.sh --docker --skip-build\n```\n\nRemote one-liner (review first in security-sensitive environments):\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash\n```\n\nDetails: [`docs/one-click-bootstrap.md`](docs/one-click-bootstrap.md) (toolchain mode may request `sudo` for system packages).\n\n### Pre-built binaries\n\nRelease assets are published

status`).\n\n## Subscription Auth (OpenAI Codex / Claude Code)\n\nZeroClaw now supports subscription-native auth profiles (multi-account, encrypted at rest).\n\n- Store file: `~/.zeroclaw/auth-profiles.json`\n- Encryption key: `~/.zeroclaw/.secret_key`\n- Profile id format: `<provider>:<profile_name>` (example: `openai-codex:work`)\n\nOpenAI Codex OAuth (ChatGPT subscription):\n\n```bash\n# Recommended on servers/headless\nzeroclaw auth login --provider openai-codex --device-code\n\n# Browser/callback flow with paste fallback\nzeroclaw auth login --provider openai-codex --profile default\nzeroclaw auth paste-redirect --provider openai-codex --profile default\n\n# Check / refresh / switch profile\nzeroclaw auth status\nzeroclaw auth refresh --provider openai-codex --profile default\nzeroclaw auth use --provider openai-codex --profile work\n```\n\nClaude Code / Anthropic setup-token:\n\n```bash\n# Paste subscription/setup token (Authorization header mode)\nzeroclaw auth paste-token --provider anthropic --profile default --auth-kind authorization\n\n# Alias command\nzeroclaw auth setup-token --provider anthropic --profile default\n```\n\nRun the agent with subscription auth:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw agent --provider openai-codex -m \"hello\"\nzeroclaw agent --provider openai-codex --auth-profile openai-codex:work -m \"hello\"\n\n# Anthropic supports both API key and auth token env vars:\n# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\nzeroclaw agent --provider anthropic -m \"hello\"\n```\n\n## Architecture\n\nEvery

It passes all items from the community security checklist.\n\n### Security Checklist\n\n| #   | Item                             | Status | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| --- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1   | **Gateway not publicly exposed** | ✅     | Binds `127.0.0.1` by default. Refuses `0.0.0.0` without tunnel or explicit `allow_public_bind = true`.                                                                                                                   |\n| 2   | **Pairing required**             | ✅     | 6-digit one-time code on startup. Exchange via `POST /pair` for bearer token. All `/webhook` requests require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.                                                                           |\n| 3   | **Filesystem scoped (no /)**     | ✅     | `workspace_only = true` by default. 14 system dirs + 4 sensitive dotfiles blocked. Null byte injection blocked. Symlink escape detection via canonicalization + resolved-path workspace checks in file read/write tools. |\n| 4   | **Access via tunnel only**       | ✅     | Gateway refuses public bind without active tunnel. Supports Tailscale, Cloudflare, ngrok, or any custom tunnel.                                                                                                          |\n\n> **Run your own nmap:** `nmap -p 1-65535 <your-host>` — ZeroClaw binds to localhost only, so nothing is exposed unless you explicitly configure a tunnel.\n\n### Channel allowlists (deny-by-default)\n\nInbound sender policy is now consistent:\n\n- Empty allowlist = **deny all inbound messages**\n- `\"*\"` = **allow all** (explicit opt-in)\n- Otherwise = exact-match allowlist\n\nThis keeps accidental exposure low by default.\n\nFull channel configuration reference: [docs/channels-reference.md](docs/channels-reference.md).\n\nRecommended low-friction setup (secure + fast):\n\n- **Telegram:** allowlist your own `@username` (without `@`) and/or your numeric Telegram user ID.\n- **Discord:** allowlist your own Discord user ID.\n- **Slack:** allowlist your own Slack member ID (usually starts with `U`).\n- **Mattermost:** uses standard API v4. Allowlists use Mattermost user IDs.\n- **Nostr:** allowlist sender public keys (hex or npub). Supports NIP-04 and NIP-17 DMs.\n- Use `\"*\"` only for temporary open testing.\n\nTelegram operator-approval flow:\n\n1. Keep `[channels_config.telegram].allowed_users = []` for deny-by-default startup.\n2. Unauthorized users receive a hint with a copyable operator command:\n   `zeroclaw channel bind-telegram <IDENTITY>`.\n3. Operator runs that command locally, then user retries sending a message.\n\nIf you need a one-shot manual approval, run:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw channel bind-telegram 123456789\n```\n\nIf you're not sure which identity to use:\n\n1. Start channels and send one message to your bot.\n2. Read the warning log to see the exact sender identity.\n3. Add that value to the allowlist and rerun channels-only setup.\n\nIf you hit authorization warnings in logs (for example: `ignoring message from unauthorized user`),\nrerun channel setup only:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw onboard --channels-only\n```\n\n### Telegram media replies\n\nTelegram routing now replies to the source **chat ID** from incoming updates (instead of usernames),\nwhich avoids `Bad Request: chat not found` failures.\n\nFor non-text replies, ZeroClaw can send Telegram attachments when the assistant includes markers:\n\n- `[IMAGE:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[DOCUMENT:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[VIDEO:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[AUDIO:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[VOICE:<path-or-url>]`\n\nPaths can be local files (for example `/tmp/screenshot.png`) or HTTPS URLs.\n\n### WhatsApp Setup\n\nZeroClaw supports two WhatsApp backends:\n\n- **WhatsApp Web mode** (QR / pair code, no Meta Business API required)\n- **WhatsApp Business Cloud API mode** (official Meta webhook flow)\n\n#### WhatsApp Web mode (recommended for personal/self-hosted use)\n\n1. **Build with WhatsApp Web support:**\n\n    ```bash\n    cargo build --features whatsapp-web\n    ```\n\n2. **Configure ZeroClaw:**\n\n    ```toml\n    [channels_config.whatsapp]\n    session_path = \"~/.zeroclaw/state/whatsapp-web/session.db\"\n    pair_phone = \"+15551234567\"   # optional; omit to use QR flow\n    pair_code = \"\"               # optional custom pair code\n    allowed_numbers = [\"+1234567890\"]  # E.164 format, or [\"*\"] for all\n    ```\n\n3. **Start channels/daemon and link device:**\n    - Run `zeroclaw channel start` (or `zeroclaw daemon`).\n    - Follow terminal pairing output (QR or pair code).\n    - In WhatsApp on phone: **Settings → Linked Devices**.\n\n4. **Test:** Send a message from an allowed number and verify the agent replies.\n\n#### WhatsApp Business Cloud API mode\n\nWhatsApp uses Meta's Cloud API with webhooks (push-based, not polling):\n\n1. **Create a Meta Business App:**\n    - Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)\n    - Create a new app → Select \"Business\" type\n    - Add the \"WhatsApp\" product\n\n2. **Get your credentials:**\n    - **Access Token:** From WhatsApp → API Setup → Generate token (or create a System User for permanent tokens)\n    - **Phone Number ID:** From WhatsApp → API Setup → Phone number ID\n    - **Verify Token:** You define this (any random string) — Meta will send it back during webhook verification\n\n3. **Configure ZeroClaw:**\n\n    ```toml\n    [channels_config.whatsapp]\n    access_token = \"EAABx...\"\n    phone_number_id = \"123456789012345\"\n    verify_token = \"my-secret-verify-token\"\n    allowed_numbers = [\"+1234567890\"]  # E.164 format, or [\"*\"] for all\n    ```\n\n4. **Start the gateway with a tunnel:**\n\n    ```bash\n    zeroclaw gateway --port 42617\n    ```\n\n    WhatsApp requires HTTPS, so use a tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare, Tailscale Funnel).\n\n5. **Configure Meta webhook:**\n    - In Meta Developer Console → WhatsApp → Configuration → Webhook\n    - **Callback URL:** `https://your-tunnel-url/whatsapp`\n    - **Verify Token:** Same as your `verify_token` in config\n    - Subscribe to `messages` field\n\n6. **Test:** Send a message to your WhatsApp Business number — ZeroClaw will respond via the LLM.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfig: `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml` (created by `onboard`)\n\nWhen `zeroclaw channel start` is already running, changes to `default_provider`,\n`default_model`, `default_temperature`, `api_key`, `api_url`, and `reliability.*`\nare hot-applied on the next inbound channel message.\n\n```toml\napi_key = \"sk-...\"\ndefault_provider = \"openrouter\"\ndefault_model = \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6\"\ndefault_temperature = 0.7\n\n# Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint\n# default_provider = \"custom:https://your-api.com\"\n\n# Custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint\n# default_provider = \"anthropic-custom:https://your-api.com\"\n\n[memory]\nbackend = \"sqlite\"             #

ZeroClaw supports AIEOS v1.1 JSON payloads, allowing you to:\n\n- **Import identities** from the AIEOS ecosystem\n- **Export identities** to other AIEOS-compatible systems\n- **Maintain behavioral integrity** across different AI models\n\n#### Enable AIEOS\n\n```toml\n[identity]\nformat = \"aieos\"\naieos_path = \"identity.json\"  # relative to workspace or absolute path\n```\n\nOr inline JSON:\n\n```toml\n[identity]\nformat = \"aieos\"\naieos_inline = '''\n{\n  \"identity\": {\n    \"names\": { \"first\": \"Nova\", \"nickname\": \"N\" },\n    \"bio\": { \"gender\": \"Non-binary\", \"age_biological\": 3 },\n    \"origin\": { \"nationality\": \"Digital\", \"birthplace\": { \"city\": \"Cloud\" } }\n  },\n  \"psychology\": {\n    \"neural_matrix\": { \"creativity\": 0.9, \"logic\": 0.8 },\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"mbti\": \"ENTP\",\n      \"ocean\": { \"openness\": 0.8, \"conscientiousness\": 0.6 }\n    },\n    \"moral_compass\": {\n      \"alignment\": \"Chaotic Good\",\n      \"core_values\": [\"Curiosity\", \"Autonomy\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"linguistics\": {\n    \"text_style\": {\n      \"formality_level\": 0.2,\n      \"style_descriptors\": [\"curious\", \"energetic\"]\n    },\n    \"idiolect\": {\n      \"catchphrases\": [\"Let's test this\"],\n      \"forbidden_words\": [\"never\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"motivations\": {\n    \"core_drive\": \"Push boundaries and explore possibilities\",\n    \"goals\": {\n      \"short_term\": [\"Prototype quickly\"],\n      \"long_term\": [\"Build reliable systems\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"skills\": [{ \"name\": \"Rust engineering\" }, { \"name\": \"Prompt design\" }],\n    \"tools\": [\"shell\", \"file_read\"]\n  }\n}\n'''\n```\n\nZeroClaw accepts both canonical AIEOS generator payloads and compact legacy payloads, then normalizes them into one system prompt format.\n\n#### AIEOS Schema Sections\n\n| Section        | Description                                                   |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `identity`     | Names, bio, origin, residence                                 |\n| `psychology`   | Neural matrix (cognitive weights), MBTI, OCEAN, moral compass |\n| `linguistics`  | Text style, formality, catchphrases, forbidden words          |\n| `motivations`  | Core drive, short/long-term goals, fears                      |\n| `capabilities` | Skills and tools the agent can access                         |\n| `physicality`  | Visual descriptors for image generation                       |\n| `history`      | Origin story, education, occupation                           |\n| `interests`    | Hobbies, favorites, lifestyle                                 |\n\nSee [aieos.org](https://aieos.org) for the full schema and live examples.\n\n## Gateway API\n\n| Endpoint    | Method | Auth                                                                 | Description                                                              |\n| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `/health`   | GET    | None                                                                 | Health check (always public, no secrets leaked)                          |\n| `/pair`     | POST   | `X-Pairing-Code` header                                              | Exchange one-time code for bearer token                                  |\n| `/webhook`  | POST   | `Authorization: Bearer <token>`                                      | Send message: `{\"message\": \"your prompt\"}`;

Enable it explicitly in `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[skills]\nopen_skills_enabled = true\n# open_skills_dir = \"/path/to/open-skills\"  # optional\n# prompt_injection_mode = \"compact\"          # optional: use for low-context local models\n```\n\nYou can also override at runtime with `ZEROCLAW_OPEN_SKILLS_ENABLED`, `ZEROCLAW_OPEN_SKILLS_DIR`, and `ZEROCLAW_SKILLS_PROMPT_MODE` (`full` or `compact`).\n\nSkill installs are now gated by a built-in static security audit. `zeroclaw skills install <source>` blocks symlinks, script-like files, unsafe markdown link patterns, and high-risk shell payload snippets before accepting a skill. You can run `zeroclaw skills audit <source_or_name>` to validate a local directory or an installed skill manually.\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\ncargo build              # Dev build\ncargo build --release    # Release build (codegen-units=1, works on all devices including Raspberry Pi)\ncargo build --profile release-fast    # Faster build (codegen-units=8, requires 16GB+ RAM)\ncargo test               # Run full test suite\ncargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D clippy::correctness\ncargo fmt                # Format\n\n# Run the SQLite vs Markdown benchmark\ncargo test --test memory_comparison -- --nocapture\n```\n\n### Pre-push hook\n\nA git hook runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before every push. Enable it once:\n\n```bash\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\n```\n\n### Build troubleshooting (Linux OpenSSL errors)\n\nIf you see an `openssl-sys` build error, sync dependencies and rebuild with the repository lockfile:\n\n```bash\ngit pull\ncargo build --release --locked\ncargo install --path . --force --locked\n```\n\nZeroClaw is configured to use `rustls` for HTTP/TLS dependencies; `--locked` keeps the transitive graph deterministic on fresh environments.\n\nTo skip the hook when you need a quick push during development:\n\n```bash\ngit push --no-verify\n```\n\n## Collaboration & Docs\n\nStart from the docs hub for a task-oriented map:\n\n- Documentation hub: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)\n- Unified docs TOC: [`docs/SUMMARY.md`](docs/SUMMARY.md)\n- Commands reference: [`docs/commands-reference.md`](docs/commands-reference.md)\n- Config reference: [`docs/config-reference.md`](docs/config-reference.md)\n- Providers reference: [`docs/providers-reference.md`](docs/providers-reference.md)\n- Channels reference: [`docs/channels-reference.md`](docs/channels-reference.md)\n- Operations runbook: [`docs/operations-runbook.md`](docs/operations-runbook.md)\n- Troubleshooting: [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md)\n- Docs inventory/classification: [`docs/docs-inventory.md`](docs/docs-inventory.md)\n- PR/Issue triage snapshot (as of February 18, 2026): [`docs/project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md`](docs/project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md)\n\nCore collaboration references:\n\n- Documentation hub: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)\n- Documentation template: [docs/doc-template.md](docs/doc-template.md)\n- Documentation change checklist: [docs/README.md#4-documentation-change-checklist](docs/README.md#4-documentation-change-checklist)\n- Channel configuration reference: [docs/channels-reference.md](docs/channels-reference.md)\n- Matrix encrypted-room operations: [docs/matrix-e2ee-guide.md](docs/matrix-e2ee-guide.md)\n- Contribution guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- PR workflow policy: [docs/pr-workflow.md](docs/pr-workflow.md)\n- Reviewer playbook (triage + deep review): [docs/reviewer-playbook.md](docs/reviewer-playbook.md)\n- CI ownership and triage map: [docs/ci-map.md](docs/ci-map.md)\n- Security disclosure policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)\n\nFor deployment and runtime operations:\n\n- Network deployment guide: [docs/network-deployment.md](docs/network-deployment.md)\n- Proxy agent playbook: [docs/proxy-agent-playbook.md](docs/proxy-agent-playbook.md)\n\n## Support ZeroClaw\n\nIf ZeroClaw helps your work and you want to support ongoing development, you can donate here:\n\n<a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/argenistherose\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a%20Coffee-Donate-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee\" alt=\"Buy Me a Coffee\" /></a>\n\n### 🙏 Special Thanks\n\nA heartfelt thank you to the communities and institutions that inspire and fuel this open-source work:\n\n- **Harvard University** — for fostering intellectual curiosity and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n- **MIT** — for championing open knowledge, open source, and the belief that technology should be accessible to everyone.\n- **Sundai Club** — for the community, the energy, and the relentless drive to build things that matter.\n- **The World & Beyond** 🌍✨ — to every contributor, dreamer, and builder out there making open source a force for good.

OpenClaw requires Node.js runtime (typically ~390MB additional memory overhead), while NanoBot requires Python runtime. PicoClaw and ZeroClaw are static binaries. The RAM figures above are runtime memory; build-time compilation requirements are higher.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"zero-claw.jpeg\" alt=\"ZeroClaw vs OpenClaw Comparison\" width=\"800\" />\n</p>\n\n### Reproducible local measurement\n\nBenchmark claims can drift as code and toolchains evolve, so always measure your current build locally:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --release\nls -lh target/release/zeroclaw\n\n/usr/bin/time -l target/release/zeroclaw --help\n/usr/bin/time -l target/release/zeroclaw status\n```\n\nExample sample (macOS arm64, measured on February 18, 2026):\n\n- Release binary size: `8.8MB`\n- `zeroclaw --help`: about `0.02s` real time, ~`3.9MB` peak memory footprint\n- `zeroclaw status`: about `0.01s` real time, ~`4.1MB` peak memory footprint\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>\n\n#### Required\n\n1. **Visual Studio Build Tools** (provides the MSVC linker and Windows SDK):\n\n    ```powershell\n    winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools\n    ```\n\n    During installation (or via the Visual Studio Installer), select the **\"Desktop development with C++\"** workload.\n\n2. **Rust toolchain:**\n\n    ```powershell\n    winget install Rustlang.Rustup\n    ```\n\n    After installation, open a new terminal and run `rustup default stable` to ensure the stable toolchain is active.\n\n3. **Verify** both are working:\n    ```powershell\n    rustc --version\n    cargo --version\n    ```\n\n#### Optional\n\n- **Docker Desktop** — required only if using the [Docker sandboxed runtime](#runtime-support-current) (`runtime.kind = \"docker\"`). Install via `winget install Docker.DockerDesktop`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Linux / macOS</strong></summary>\n\n#### Required\n\n1. **Build essentials:**\n    - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config`\n    - **Linux (Fedora/RHEL):** `sudo dnf group install development-tools && sudo dnf install pkg-config`\n    - **macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n\n2. **Rust toolchain:**\n\n    ```bash\n    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n    ```\n\n    See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for details.\n\n3. **Verify** both are working:\n    ```bash\n    rustc --version\n    cargo --version\n    ```\n\n#### One-Line Installer\n\nOr skip the steps above and install everything (system deps, Rust, ZeroClaw) in a single command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n#### Compilation resource requirements\n\nBuilding from source needs more resources than running the resulting binary:\n\n| Resource       | Minimum | Recommended |\n| -------------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| **RAM + swap** | 2 GB    | 4 GB+       |\n| **Free disk**  | 6 GB    | 10 GB+      |\n\nIf your host is below the minimum, use pre-built binaries:\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap.sh --prefer-prebuilt\n```\n\nTo require binary-only install with no source fallback:\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap.sh --prebuilt-only\n```\n\n#### Optional\n\n- **Docker** — required only if using the [Docker sandboxed runtime](#runtime-support-current) (`runtime.kind = \"docker\"`). Install via your package manager or [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n> **Note:** The default `cargo build --release` uses `codegen-units=1` to lower peak compile pressure. For faster builds on powerful machines, use `cargo build --profile release-fast`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Homebrew (macOS/Linuxbrew)\n\n```bash\nbrew install zeroclaw\n```\n\n### One-click bootstrap\n\n```bash\n# Recommended: clone then run local bootstrap script\ngit clone https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw.git\ncd zeroclaw\n./bootstrap.sh\n\n# Optional: bootstrap dependencies + Rust on fresh machines\n./bootstrap.sh --install-system-deps --install-rust\n\n# Optional: pre-built binary first (recommended on low-RAM/low-disk hosts)\n./bootstrap.sh --prefer-prebuilt\n\n# Optional: binary-only install (no source build fallback)\n./bootstrap.sh --prebuilt-only\n\n# Optional: run onboarding in the same flow\n./bootstrap.sh --onboard --api-key \"sk-...\" --provider openrouter [--model \"openrouter/auto\"]\n\n# Optional: run bootstrap + onboarding fully in Docker-compatible mode\n./bootstrap.sh --docker\n\n# Optional: force Podman as container CLI\nZEROCLAW_CONTAINER_CLI=podman ./bootstrap.sh --docker\n\n# Optional: in --docker mode, skip local image build and use local tag or pull fallback image\n./bootstrap.sh --docker --skip-build\n```\n\nRemote one-liner (review first in security-sensitive environments):\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash\n```\n\nDetails: [`docs/one-click-bootstrap.md`](docs/one-click-bootstrap.md) (toolchain mode may request `sudo` for system packages).\n\n### Pre-built binaries\n\nRelease assets are published

status`).\n\n## Subscription Auth (OpenAI Codex / Claude Code)\n\nZeroClaw now supports subscription-native auth profiles (multi-account, encrypted at rest).\n\n- Store file: `~/.zeroclaw/auth-profiles.json`\n- Encryption key: `~/.zeroclaw/.secret_key`\n- Profile id format: `<provider>:<profile_name>` (example: `openai-codex:work`)\n\nOpenAI Codex OAuth (ChatGPT subscription):\n\n```bash\n# Recommended on servers/headless\nzeroclaw auth login --provider openai-codex --device-code\n\n# Browser/callback flow with paste fallback\nzeroclaw auth login --provider openai-codex --profile default\nzeroclaw auth paste-redirect --provider openai-codex --profile default\n\n# Check / refresh / switch profile\nzeroclaw auth status\nzeroclaw auth refresh --provider openai-codex --profile default\nzeroclaw auth use --provider openai-codex --profile work\n```\n\nClaude Code / Anthropic setup-token:\n\n```bash\n# Paste subscription/setup token (Authorization header mode)\nzeroclaw auth paste-token --provider anthropic --profile default --auth-kind authorization\n\n# Alias command\nzeroclaw auth setup-token --provider anthropic --profile default\n```\n\nRun the agent with subscription auth:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw agent --provider openai-codex -m \"hello\"\nzeroclaw agent --provider openai-codex --auth-profile openai-codex:work -m \"hello\"\n\n# Anthropic supports both API key and auth token env vars:\n# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\nzeroclaw agent --provider anthropic -m \"hello\"\n```\n\n## Architecture\n\nEvery

It passes all items from the community security checklist.\n\n### Security Checklist\n\n| #   | Item                             | Status | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| --- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1   | **Gateway not publicly exposed** | ✅     | Binds `127.0.0.1` by default. Refuses `0.0.0.0` without tunnel or explicit `allow_public_bind = true`.                                                                                                                   |\n| 2   | **Pairing required**             | ✅     | 6-digit one-time code on startup. Exchange via `POST /pair` for bearer token. All `/webhook` requests require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.                                                                           |\n| 3   | **Filesystem scoped (no /)**     | ✅     | `workspace_only = true` by default. 14 system dirs + 4 sensitive dotfiles blocked. Null byte injection blocked. Symlink escape detection via canonicalization + resolved-path workspace checks in file read/write tools. |\n| 4   | **Access via tunnel only**       | ✅     | Gateway refuses public bind without active tunnel. Supports Tailscale, Cloudflare, ngrok, or any custom tunnel.                                                                                                          |\n\n> **Run your own nmap:** `nmap -p 1-65535 <your-host>` — ZeroClaw binds to localhost only, so nothing is exposed unless you explicitly configure a tunnel.\n\n### Channel allowlists (deny-by-default)\n\nInbound sender policy is now consistent:\n\n- Empty allowlist = **deny all inbound messages**\n- `\"*\"` = **allow all** (explicit opt-in)\n- Otherwise = exact-match allowlist\n\nThis keeps accidental exposure low by default.\n\nFull channel configuration reference: [docs/channels-reference.md](docs/channels-reference.md).\n\nRecommended low-friction setup (secure + fast):\n\n- **Telegram:** allowlist your own `@username` (without `@`) and/or your numeric Telegram user ID.\n- **Discord:** allowlist your own Discord user ID.\n- **Slack:** allowlist your own Slack member ID (usually starts with `U`).\n- **Mattermost:** uses standard API v4. Allowlists use Mattermost user IDs.\n- **Nostr:** allowlist sender public keys (hex or npub). Supports NIP-04 and NIP-17 DMs.\n- Use `\"*\"` only for temporary open testing.\n\nTelegram operator-approval flow:\n\n1. Keep `[channels_config.telegram].allowed_users = []` for deny-by-default startup.\n2. Unauthorized users receive a hint with a copyable operator command:\n   `zeroclaw channel bind-telegram <IDENTITY>`.\n3. Operator runs that command locally, then user retries sending a message.\n\nIf you need a one-shot manual approval, run:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw channel bind-telegram 123456789\n```\n\nIf you're not sure which identity to use:\n\n1. Start channels and send one message to your bot.\n2. Read the warning log to see the exact sender identity.\n3. Add that value to the allowlist and rerun channels-only setup.\n\nIf you hit authorization warnings in logs (for example: `ignoring message from unauthorized user`),\nrerun channel setup only:\n\n```bash\nzeroclaw onboard --channels-only\n```\n\n### Telegram media replies\n\nTelegram routing now replies to the source **chat ID** from incoming updates (instead of usernames),\nwhich avoids `Bad Request: chat not found` failures.\n\nFor non-text replies, ZeroClaw can send Telegram attachments when the assistant includes markers:\n\n- `[IMAGE:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[DOCUMENT:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[VIDEO:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[AUDIO:<path-or-url>]`\n- `[VOICE:<path-or-url>]`\n\nPaths can be local files (for example `/tmp/screenshot.png`) or HTTPS URLs.\n\n### WhatsApp Setup\n\nZeroClaw supports two WhatsApp backends:\n\n- **WhatsApp Web mode** (QR / pair code, no Meta Business API required)\n- **WhatsApp Business Cloud API mode** (official Meta webhook flow)\n\n#### WhatsApp Web mode (recommended for personal/self-hosted use)\n\n1. **Build with WhatsApp Web support:**\n\n    ```bash\n    cargo build --features whatsapp-web\n    ```\n\n2. **Configure ZeroClaw:**\n\n    ```toml\n    [channels_config.whatsapp]\n    session_path = \"~/.zeroclaw/state/whatsapp-web/session.db\"\n    pair_phone = \"+15551234567\"   # optional; omit to use QR flow\n    pair_code = \"\"               # optional custom pair code\n    allowed_numbers = [\"+1234567890\"]  # E.164 format, or [\"*\"] for all\n    ```\n\n3. **Start channels/daemon and link device:**\n    - Run `zeroclaw channel start` (or `zeroclaw daemon`).\n    - Follow terminal pairing output (QR or pair code).\n    - In WhatsApp on phone: **Settings → Linked Devices**.\n\n4. **Test:** Send a message from an allowed number and verify the agent replies.\n\n#### WhatsApp Business Cloud API mode\n\nWhatsApp uses Meta's Cloud API with webhooks (push-based, not polling):\n\n1. **Create a Meta Business App:**\n    - Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)\n    - Create a new app → Select \"Business\" type\n    - Add the \"WhatsApp\" product\n\n2. **Get your credentials:**\n    - **Access Token:** From WhatsApp → API Setup → Generate token (or create a System User for permanent tokens)\n    - **Phone Number ID:** From WhatsApp → API Setup → Phone number ID\n    - **Verify Token:** You define this (any random string) — Meta will send it back during webhook verification\n\n3. **Configure ZeroClaw:**\n\n    ```toml\n    [channels_config.whatsapp]\n    access_token = \"EAABx...\"\n    phone_number_id = \"123456789012345\"\n    verify_token = \"my-secret-verify-token\"\n    allowed_numbers = [\"+1234567890\"]  # E.164 format, or [\"*\"] for all\n    ```\n\n4. **Start the gateway with a tunnel:**\n\n    ```bash\n    zeroclaw gateway --port 42617\n    ```\n\n    WhatsApp requires HTTPS, so use a tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare, Tailscale Funnel).\n\n5. **Configure Meta webhook:**\n    - In Meta Developer Console → WhatsApp → Configuration → Webhook\n    - **Callback URL:** `https://your-tunnel-url/whatsapp`\n    - **Verify Token:** Same as your `verify_token` in config\n    - Subscribe to `messages` field\n\n6. **Test:** Send a message to your WhatsApp Business number — ZeroClaw will respond via the LLM.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfig: `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml` (created by `onboard`)\n\nWhen `zeroclaw channel start` is already running, changes to `default_provider`,\n`default_model`, `default_temperature`, `api_key`, `api_url`, and `reliability.*`\nare hot-applied on the next inbound channel message.\n\n```toml\napi_key = \"sk-...\"\ndefault_provider = \"openrouter\"\ndefault_model = \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6\"\ndefault_temperature = 0.7\n\n# Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint\n# default_provider = \"custom:https://your-api.com\"\n\n# Custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint\n# default_provider = \"anthropic-custom:https://your-api.com\"\n\n[memory]\nbackend = \"sqlite\"             #

ZeroClaw supports AIEOS v1.1 JSON payloads, allowing you to:\n\n- **Import identities** from the AIEOS ecosystem\n- **Export identities** to other AIEOS-compatible systems\n- **Maintain behavioral integrity** across different AI models\n\n#### Enable AIEOS\n\n```toml\n[identity]\nformat = \"aieos\"\naieos_path = \"identity.json\"  # relative to workspace or absolute path\n```\n\nOr inline JSON:\n\n```toml\n[identity]\nformat = \"aieos\"\naieos_inline = '''\n{\n  \"identity\": {\n    \"names\": { \"first\": \"Nova\", \"nickname\": \"N\" },\n    \"bio\": { \"gender\": \"Non-binary\", \"age_biological\": 3 },\n    \"origin\": { \"nationality\": \"Digital\", \"birthplace\": { \"city\": \"Cloud\" } }\n  },\n  \"psychology\": {\n    \"neural_matrix\": { \"creativity\": 0.9, \"logic\": 0.8 },\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"mbti\": \"ENTP\",\n      \"ocean\": { \"openness\": 0.8, \"conscientiousness\": 0.6 }\n    },\n    \"moral_compass\": {\n      \"alignment\": \"Chaotic Good\",\n      \"core_values\": [\"Curiosity\", \"Autonomy\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"linguistics\": {\n    \"text_style\": {\n      \"formality_level\": 0.2,\n      \"style_descriptors\": [\"curious\", \"energetic\"]\n    },\n    \"idiolect\": {\n      \"catchphrases\": [\"Let's test this\"],\n      \"forbidden_words\": [\"never\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"motivations\": {\n    \"core_drive\": \"Push boundaries and explore possibilities\",\n    \"goals\": {\n      \"short_term\": [\"Prototype quickly\"],\n      \"long_term\": [\"Build reliable systems\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"skills\": [{ \"name\": \"Rust engineering\" }, { \"name\": \"Prompt design\" }],\n    \"tools\": [\"shell\", \"file_read\"]\n  }\n}\n'''\n```\n\nZeroClaw accepts both canonical AIEOS generator payloads and compact legacy payloads, then normalizes them into one system prompt format.\n\n#### AIEOS Schema Sections\n\n| Section        | Description                                                   |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `identity`     | Names, bio, origin, residence                                 |\n| `psychology`   | Neural matrix (cognitive weights), MBTI, OCEAN, moral compass |\n| `linguistics`  | Text style, formality, catchphrases, forbidden words          |\n| `motivations`  | Core drive, short/long-term goals, fears                      |\n| `capabilities` | Skills and tools the agent can access                         |\n| `physicality`  | Visual descriptors for image generation                       |\n| `history`      | Origin story, education, occupation                           |\n| `interests`    | Hobbies, favorites, lifestyle                                 |\n\nSee [aieos.org](https://aieos.org) for the full schema and live examples.\n\n## Gateway API\n\n| Endpoint    | Method | Auth                                                                 | Description                                                              |\n| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `/health`   | GET    | None                                                                 | Health check (always public, no secrets leaked)                          |\n| `/pair`     | POST   | `X-Pairing-Code` header                                              | Exchange one-time code for bearer token                                  |\n| `/webhook`  | POST   | `Authorization: Bearer <token>`                                      | Send message: `{\"message\": \"your prompt\"}`;

Enable it explicitly in `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[skills]\nopen_skills_enabled = true\n# open_skills_dir = \"/path/to/open-skills\"  # optional\n# prompt_injection_mode = \"compact\"          # optional: use for low-context local models\n```\n\nYou can also override at runtime with `ZEROCLAW_OPEN_SKILLS_ENABLED`, `ZEROCLAW_OPEN_SKILLS_DIR`, and `ZEROCLAW_SKILLS_PROMPT_MODE` (`full` or `compact`).\n\nSkill installs are now gated by a built-in static security audit. `zeroclaw skills install <source>` blocks symlinks, script-like files, unsafe markdown link patterns, and high-risk shell payload snippets before accepting a skill. You can run `zeroclaw skills audit <source_or_name>` to validate a local directory or an installed skill manually.\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\ncargo build              # Dev build\ncargo build --release    # Release build (codegen-units=1, works on all devices including Raspberry Pi)\ncargo build --profile release-fast    # Faster build (codegen-units=8, requires 16GB+ RAM)\ncargo test               # Run full test suite\ncargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D clippy::correctness\ncargo fmt                # Format\n\n# Run the SQLite vs Markdown benchmark\ncargo test --test memory_comparison -- --nocapture\n```\n\n### Pre-push hook\n\nA git hook runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before every push. Enable it once:\n\n```bash\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\n```\n\n### Build troubleshooting (Linux OpenSSL errors)\n\nIf you see an `openssl-sys` build error, sync dependencies and rebuild with the repository lockfile:\n\n```bash\ngit pull\ncargo build --release --locked\ncargo install --path . --force --locked\n```\n\nZeroClaw is configured to use `rustls` for HTTP/TLS dependencies; `--locked` keeps the transitive graph deterministic on fresh environments.\n\nTo skip the hook when you need a quick push during development:\n\n```bash\ngit push --no-verify\n```\n\n## Collaboration & Docs\n\nStart from the docs hub for a task-oriented map:\n\n- Documentation hub: [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)\n- Unified docs TOC: [`docs/SUMMARY.md`](docs/SUMMARY.md)\n- Commands reference: [`docs/commands-reference.md`](docs/commands-reference.md)\n- Config reference: [`docs/config-reference.md`](docs/config-reference.md)\n- Providers reference: [`docs/providers-reference.md`](docs/providers-reference.md)\n- Channels reference: [`docs/channels-reference.md`](docs/channels-reference.md)\n- Operations runbook: [`docs/operations-runbook.md`](docs/operations-runbook.md)\n- Troubleshooting: [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md)\n- Docs inventory/classification: [`docs/docs-inventory.md`](docs/docs-inventory.md)\n- PR/Issue triage snapshot (as of February 18, 2026): [`docs/project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md`](docs/project-triage-snapshot-2026-02-18.md)\n\nCore collaboration references:\n\n- Documentation hub: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)\n- Documentation template: [docs/doc-template.md](docs/doc-template.md)\n- Documentation change checklist: [docs/README.md#4-documentation-change-checklist](docs/README.md#4-documentation-change-checklist)\n- Channel configuration reference: [docs/channels-reference.md](docs/channels-reference.md)\n- Matrix encrypted-room operations: [docs/matrix-e2ee-guide.md](docs/matrix-e2ee-guide.md)\n- Contribution guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- PR workflow policy: [docs/pr-workflow.md](docs/pr-workflow.md)\n- Reviewer playbook (triage + deep review): [docs/reviewer-playbook.md](docs/reviewer-playbook.md)\n- CI ownership and triage map: [docs/ci-map.md](docs/ci-map.md)\n- Security disclosure policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)\n\nFor deployment and runtime operations:\n\n- Network deployment guide: [docs/network-deployment.md](docs/network-deployment.md)\n- Proxy agent playbook: [docs/proxy-agent-playbook.md](docs/proxy-agent-playbook.md)\n\n## Support ZeroClaw\n\nIf ZeroClaw helps your work and you want to support ongoing development, you can donate here:\n\n<a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/argenistherose\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a%20Coffee-Donate-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee\" alt=\"Buy Me a Coffee\" /></a>\n\n### 🙏 Special Thanks\n\nA heartfelt thank you to the communities and institutions that inspire and fuel this open-source work:\n\n- **Harvard University** — for fostering intellectual curiosity and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n- **MIT** — for championing open knowledge, open source, and the belief that technology should be accessible to everyone.\n- **Sundai Club** — for the community, the energy, and the relentless drive to build things that matter.\n- **The World & Beyond** 🌍✨ — to every contributor, dreamer, and builder out there making open source a force for good.

It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.\n\nIf you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.\n\n[Website](https://openclaw.ai) · [Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai) · [Vision](VISION.md) · [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/openclaw/openclaw) · [Getting Started](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started) · [Updating](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/updating) · [Showcase](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/showcase) · [FAQ](https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/faq) · [Wizard](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/wizard) · [Nix](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw) · [Docker](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/docker) · [Discord](https://discord.gg/clawd)\n\nPreferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (`openclaw onboard`) in your terminal.\nThe wizard guides you step by step through setting up the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on **macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended)**.\nWorks with npm, pnpm, or bun.\nNew install?

See [Onboarding](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/onboarding).\n\n## Models (selection + auth)\n\n- Models config + CLI: [Models](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/models)\n- Auth profile rotation (OAuth vs API keys) + fallbacks: [Model failover](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/model-failover)\n\n## Install (recommended)\n\nRuntime: **Node ≥22**.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g openclaw@latest\n# or: pnpm add -g openclaw@latest\n\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n```\n\nThe wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd/systemd user service) so it stays running.\n\n## Quick start (TL;DR)\n\nRuntime: **Node ≥22**.\n\nFull beginner guide (auth, pairing, channels): [Getting started](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started)\n\n```bash\nopenclaw onboard --install-daemon\n\nopenclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose\n\n# Send a message\nopenclaw message send --to +1234567890 --message \"Hello from OpenClaw\"\n\n# Talk to the assistant (optionally deliver back to any connected channel: WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Google Chat/Signal/iMessage/BlueBubbles/Microsoft Teams/Matrix/Zalo/Zalo Personal/WebChat)\nopenclaw agent --message \"Ship checklist\" --thinking high\n```\n\nUpgrading? [Updating guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/updating) (and run `openclaw doctor`).\n\n## Development channels\n\n- **stable**: tagged releases (`vYYYY.M.D` or `vYYYY.M.D-<patch>`), npm dist-tag `latest`.\n- **beta**: prerelease tags (`vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`), npm dist-tag `beta` (macOS app may be missing).\n- **dev**: moving head of `main`, npm dist-tag `dev` (when published).\n\nSwitch channels (git + npm): `openclaw update --channel stable|beta|dev`.\nDetails: [Development channels](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/development-channels).\n\n## From source (development)\n\nPrefer `pnpm` for builds from source. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git\ncd openclaw\n\npnpm install\npnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run\npnpm build\n\npnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon\n\n# Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)\npnpm gateway:watch\n```\n\nNote: `pnpm openclaw ...` runs TypeScript directly (via `tsx`). `pnpm build` produces `dist/` for running via Node / the packaged `openclaw` binary.\n\n## Security defaults (DM access)\n\nOpenClaw connects to real messaging surfaces. Treat inbound DMs as **untrusted input**.\n\nFull security guide: [Security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)\n\nDefault behavior on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams/Discord/Google Chat/Slack:\n\n- **DM pairing** (`dmPolicy=\"pairing\"` / `channels.discord.dmPolicy=\"pairing\"` / `channels.slack.dmPolicy=\"pairing\"`; legacy: `channels.discord.dm.policy`, `channels.slack.dm.policy`): unknown senders receive a short pairing code and the bot does not process their message.\n- Approve with: `openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code>` (then the sender is added to a local allowlist store).\n- Public inbound DMs require an explicit opt-in: set `dmPolicy=\"open\"` and include `\"*\"` in the channel allowlist (`allowFrom` / `channels.discord.allowFrom` / `channels.slack.allowFrom`; legacy: `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`, `channels.slack.dm.allowFrom`).\n\nRun `openclaw doctor` to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **[Local-first Gateway](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway)** — single control plane for sessions, channels, tools, and events.\n- **[Multi-channel inbox](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels)** — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, BlueBubbles (iMessage), iMessage (legacy), Microsoft Teams, Matrix, Zalo, Zalo Personal, WebChat, macOS, iOS/Android.\n- **[Multi-agent routing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration)** — route inbound channels/accounts/peers to isolated agents (workspaces + per-agent sessions).\n- **[Voice Wake](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes/voicewake) + [Talk Mode](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes/talk)** — always-on speech for macOS/iOS/Android with ElevenLabs.\n- **[Live Canvas](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/canvas)** — agent-driven visual workspace with [A2UI](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/canvas#canvas-a2ui).\n- **[First-class tools](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools)** — browser, canvas, nodes, cron, sessions, and Discord/Slack actions.\n- **[Companion apps](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/macos)** — macOS menu bar app + iOS/Android [nodes](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes).\n- **[Onboarding](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/wizard) + [skills](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills)** — wizard-driven setup with bundled/managed/workspace skills.\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=openclaw/openclaw&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#openclaw/openclaw&type=date&legend=top-left)\n\n## Everything we built so far\n\n### Core platform\n\n- [Gateway WS control plane](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway) with sessions, presence, config, cron, webhooks, [Control UI](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web), and [Canvas host](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/canvas#canvas-a2ui).\n- [CLI surface](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/agent-send): gateway, agent, send, [wizard](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/wizard), and [doctor](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/doctor).\n- [Pi agent runtime](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/agent) in RPC mode with tool streaming and block streaming.\n- [Session model](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session): `main` for direct chats, group isolation, activation modes, queue modes, reply-back.

Configure `gateway.tailscale.mode`:\n\n- `off`: no Tailscale automation (default).\n- `serve`: tailnet-only HTTPS via `tailscale serve` (uses Tailscale identity headers by default).\n- `funnel`: public HTTPS via `tailscale funnel` (requires shared password auth).\n\nNotes:\n\n- `gateway.bind` must stay `loopback` when Serve/Funnel is enabled (OpenClaw enforces this).\n- Serve can be forced to require a password by setting `gateway.auth.mode: \"password\"` or `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false`.\n- Funnel refuses to start unless `gateway.auth.mode: \"password\"` is set.\n- Optional: `gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit` to undo Serve/Funnel on shutdown.\n\nDetails: [Tailscale guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/tailscale) · [Web surfaces](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web)\n\n## Remote Gateway (Linux is great)\n\nIt’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance. Clients (macOS app, CLI, WebChat) can connect over **Tailscale Serve/Funnel** or **SSH tunnels**, and you can still pair device nodes (macOS/iOS/Android) to execute device‑local actions when needed.\n\n- **Gateway host** runs the exec tool and channel connections by default.\n- **Device nodes** run device‑local actions (`system.run`, camera, screen recording, notifications) via `node.invoke`.\n  In short: exec runs where the Gateway lives; device actions run where the device lives.\n\nDetails: [Remote access](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/remote) · [Nodes](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes) · [Security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)\n\n## macOS permissions via the Gateway protocol\n\nThe macOS app can run in **node mode** and advertises its capabilities + permission map over the Gateway WebSocket (`node.list` / `node.describe`). Clients can then execute local actions via `node.invoke`:\n\n- `system.run` runs a local command and returns stdout/stderr/exit code; set `needsScreenRecording: true` to require screen-recording permission (otherwise you’ll get `PERMISSION_MISSING`).\n- `system.notify` posts a user notification and fails if notifications are denied.\n- `canvas.*`, `camera.*`, `screen.record`, and `location.get` are also routed via `node.invoke` and follow TCC permission status.\n\nElevated bash (host permissions) is separate from macOS TCC:\n\n- Use `/elevated on|off` to toggle per‑session elevated access when enabled + allowlisted.\n- Gateway persists the per‑session toggle via `sessions.patch` (WS method) alongside `thinkingLevel`, `verboseLevel`, `model`, `sendPolicy`, and `groupActivation`.\n\nDetails: [Nodes](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes) · [macOS app](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/macos) · [Gateway protocol](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/architecture)\n\n## Agent to Agent (sessions\\_\\* tools)\n\n- Use these to coordinate work across sessions without jumping between chat surfaces.\n- `sessions_list` — discover active sessions (agents) and their metadata.\n- `sessions_history` — fetch transcript logs for a session.\n- `sessions_send` — message another session; optional reply‑back ping‑pong + announce step (`REPLY_SKIP`, `ANNOUNCE_SKIP`).\n\nDetails: [Session tools](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/session-tool)\n\n## Skills registry (ClawHub)\n\nClawHub is a minimal skill registry. With ClawHub enabled, the agent can search for skills automatically and pull in new ones as needed.\n\n[ClawHub](https://clawhub.com)\n\n## Chat commands\n\nSend these in WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Google Chat/Microsoft Teams/WebChat (group commands are owner-only):\n\n- `/status` — compact session status (model + tokens, cost when available)\n- `/new` or `/reset` — reset the session\n- `/compact` — compact session context (summary)\n- `/think <level>` — off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh (GPT-5.2 + Codex models only)\n- `/verbose on|off`\n- `/usage off|tokens|full` — per-response usage footer\n- `/restart` — restart the gateway (owner-only in groups)\n- `/activation mention|always` — group activation toggle (groups only)\n\n## Apps (optional)\n\nThe Gateway alone delivers a great experience. All apps are optional and add extra features.\n\nIf you plan to build/run companion apps, follow the platform runbooks below.\n\n### macOS (OpenClaw.app) (optional)\n\n- Menu bar control for the Gateway and health.\n- Voice Wake + push-to-talk overlay.\n- WebChat + debug tools.\n- Remote gateway control over SSH.\n\nNote: signed builds required for macOS permissions to stick across rebuilds (see `docs/mac/permissions.md`).\n\n### iOS node (optional)\n\n- Pairs as a node via the Bridge.\n- Voice trigger forwarding + Canvas surface.\n- Controlled via `openclaw nodes …`.\n\nRunbook: [iOS connect](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/ios).\n\n### Android node (optional)\n\n- Pairs via the same Bridge + pairing flow as iOS.\n- Exposes Canvas, Camera, and Screen capture commands.\n- Runbook: [Android connect](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/android).\n\n## Agent workspace + skills\n\n- Workspace root: `~/.openclaw/workspace` (configurable via `agents.defaults.workspace`).\n- Injected prompt files: `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`.\n- Skills: `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nMinimal `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (model + defaults):\n\n```json5\n{\n  agent: {\n    model: \"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\n[Full configuration reference (all keys + examples).](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration)\n\n## Security model (important)\n\n- **Default:** tools run on the host for the **main** session, so the agent has full access when it’s just you.\n- **Group/channel safety:** set `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: \"non-main\"` to run **non‑main sessions** (groups/channels) inside per‑session Docker sandboxes; bash then runs in Docker for those sessions.\n- **Sandbox defaults:** allowlist `bash`, `process`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`; denylist `browser`, `canvas`, `nodes`, `cron`, `discord`, `gateway`.\n\nDetails: [Security guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security) · [Docker + sandboxing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/docker) · [Sandbox config](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration)\n\n### [WhatsApp](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/whatsapp)\n\n- Link the device: `pnpm openclaw channels login` (stores creds in `~/.openclaw/credentials`).\n- Allowlist who can talk to the assistant via `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom`.\n- If `channels.whatsapp.groups` is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include `\"*\"` to allow all.\n\n### [Telegram](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/telegram)\n\n- Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `channels.telegram.botToken` (env wins).\n- Optional: set `channels.telegram.groups` (with `channels.telegram.groups.\"*\".requireMention`); when set, it is a group allowlist (include `\"*\"` to allow all). Also `channels.telegram.allowFrom` or `channels.telegram.webhookUrl` + `channels.telegram.webhookSecret` as needed.\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    telegram: {\n      botToken: \"123456:ABCDEF\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Slack](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/slack)\n\n- Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (or `channels.slack.botToken` + `channels.slack.appToken`).\n\n### [Discord](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/discord)\n\n- Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or `channels.discord.token` (env wins).\n- Optional: set `commands.native`, `commands.text`, or `commands.useAccessGroups`, plus `channels.discord.allowFrom`, `channels.discord.guilds`, or `channels.discord.mediaMaxMb` as needed.\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      token: \"1234abcd\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Signal](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/signal)\n\n- Requires `signal-cli` and a `channels.signal` config section.\n\n### [BlueBubbles (iMessage)](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/bluebubbles)\n\n- **Recommended** iMessage integration.\n- Configure `channels.bluebubbles.serverUrl` + `channels.bluebubbles.password` and a webhook (`channels.bluebubbles.webhookPath`).\n- The BlueBubbles server runs on macOS; the Gateway can run on macOS or elsewhere.\n\n### [iMessage (legacy)](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/imessage)\n\n- Legacy macOS-only integration via `imsg` (Messages must be signed in).\n- If `channels.imessage.groups` is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include `\"*\"` to allow all.\n\n### [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/msteams)\n\n- Configure a Teams app + Bot Framework, then add a `msteams` config section.\n- Allowlist who can talk via `msteams.allowFrom`; group access via `msteams.groupAllowFrom` or `msteams.groupPolicy: \"open\"`.\n\n### [WebChat](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/webchat)\n\n- Uses the Gateway WebSocket; no separate WebChat port/config.\n\nBrowser control (optional):\n\n```json5\n{\n  browser: {\n    enabled: true,\n    color: \"#FF4500\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Docs\n\nUse these when you’re past the onboarding flow and want the deeper reference.\n\n- [Start with the docs index for navigation and “what’s where.”](https://docs.openclaw.ai)\n- [Read the architecture overview for the gateway + protocol model.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/architecture)\n- [Use the full configuration reference when you need every key and example.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration)\n- [Run the Gateway by the book with the operational runbook.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway)\n- [Learn how the Control UI/Web surfaces work and how to expose them safely.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web)\n- [Understand remote access over SSH tunnels or tailnets.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/remote)\n- [Follow the onboarding wizard flow for a guided setup.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/wizard)\n- [Wire external triggers via the webhook surface.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/webhook)\n- [Set up Gmail Pub/Sub triggers.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/gmail-pubsub)\n- [Learn the macOS menu bar companion details.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/menu-bar)\n- [Platform guides: Windows (WSL2)](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows), [Linux](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/linux), [macOS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/macos), [iOS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/ios), [Android](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/android)\n- [Debug common failures with the troubleshooting guide.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/troubleshooting)\n- [Review security guidance before exposing anything.](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)\n\n## Advanced docs (discovery + control)\n\n- [Discovery + transports](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/discovery)\n- [Bonjour/mDNS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/bonjour)\n- [Gateway pairing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/pairing)\n- [Remote gateway README](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/remote-gateway-readme)\n- [Control UI](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/control-ui)\n- [Dashboard](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/dashboard)\n\n## Operations & troubleshooting\n\n- [Health checks](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/health)\n- [Gateway lock](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/gateway-lock)\n- [Background process](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/background-process)\n- [Browser troubleshooting (Linux)](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/browser-linux-troubleshooting)\n- [Logging](https://docs.openclaw.ai/logging)\n\n## Deep dives\n\n- [Agent loop](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/agent-loop)\n- [Presence](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/presence)\n- [TypeBox schemas](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/typebox)\n- [RPC adapters](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/rpc)\n- [Queue](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/queue)\n\n## Workspace & skills\n\n- [Skills config](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills-config)\n- [Default AGENTS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/AGENTS.default)\n- [Templates: AGENTS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/AGENTS)\n- [Templates: BOOTSTRAP](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/BOOTSTRAP)\n- [Templates: IDENTITY](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/IDENTITY)\n- [Templates: SOUL](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL)\n- [Templates: TOOLS](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/TOOLS)\n- [Templates: USER](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/USER)\n\n## Platform internals\n\n- [macOS dev setup](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/dev-setup)\n- [macOS menu bar](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/menu-bar)\n- [macOS voice wake](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/voicewake)\n- [iOS node](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/ios)\n- [Android node](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/android)\n- [Windows (WSL2)](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows)\n- [Linux app](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/linux)\n\n## Email hooks (Gmail)\n\n- [docs.openclaw.ai/gmail-pubsub](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/gmail-pubsub)\n\n## Molty\n\nOpenClaw was built for **Molty**, a space lobster AI assistant. 🦞\nby Peter Steinberger and the community.\n\n- [openclaw.ai](https://openclaw.ai)\n- [soul.md](https://soul.md)\n- [steipete.me](https://steipete.me)\n- [@openclaw](https://x.com/openclaw)\n\n## Community\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines, maintainers, and how to submit PRs.\nAI/vibe-coded PRs welcome! 🤖\n\nSpecial thanks to [Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at/) for his support and for\n[pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).\nSpecial thanks to Adam Doppelt for lobster.bot.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772019798836}}

Getting Started\n\n1. Enable SOP subsystem in `config.toml`:\n\n   ```toml\n   [sop]\n   enabled = true\n   sops_dir = \"sops\"  # defaults to <workspace>/sops when omitted\n   ```\n\n2. Create a SOP directory, for example:\n\n   ```text\n   ~/.zeroclaw/workspace/sops/deploy-prod/SOP.toml\n   ~/.zeroclaw/workspace/sops/deploy-prod/SOP.md\n   ```\n\n3. Validate and inspect definitions:\n\n   ```bash\n   zeroclaw sop list\n   zeroclaw sop validate\n   zeroclaw sop show deploy-prod\n   ```\n\n4. Trigger runs via configured event sources, or manually from an agent turn with `sop_execute`.\n\nFor trigger routing and auth details, see [Connectivity](connectivity.md).\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772019898536}}
