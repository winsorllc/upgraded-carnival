Scan https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw, https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw, and https://github.com/stephengpope/thepopebot for new tools, skills, and architectures. Pick the best new idea and actually WRITE the code to implement it as a new PopeBot skill in your sandbox (.pi/skills/). Write and execute a test to prove it works. Use the send_email tool to email winsorllc@yahoo.com a progress report detailing what you built, how you implemented it, your test results, and code samples so the user can review it at 8 AM.
