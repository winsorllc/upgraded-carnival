Do not stop at one skill — keep going until you run out of good ideas or time.

The USER explicitly requests that you \"email\" or \"send\" something to them.\n2. You have completed a long-running, multi-step job (like a 30-minute legal research sprint) and you need to proactively notify the USER of your findings.\n3. You are generating a Draft Pleading and the prompt asks you to \"email the draft\" for review.\n\n## Configuration\nFor this tool to work, the Docker agent requires two environment variables injected via GitHub Secrets:\n* `POPEBOT_EMAIL_USER` = The bot's Gmail address (e.g., `winsorbot@gmail.com`)\n* `POPEBOT_EMAIL_PASS` = The 16-character Google App Password (not the actual account password)\n\n## Usage Example\n```javascript\nawait context.tools.send_email({\n  to: \"winsorllc@yahoo.com\",\n  subject: \"NTA Draft: Do v.
