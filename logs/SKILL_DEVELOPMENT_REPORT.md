## Implementation Notes

### Patterns from ZeroClaw
- Lean runtime with minimal dependencies
- `doctor` command pattern for diagnostics
- Bootstrap/installation scripts
- Shell completion generation

### Patterns from OpenClaw
- Multi-channel support architecture
- Webhook automation
- Skills platform structure
- Session and memory management

### PopeBot Skill Structure
Each skill follows standard pattern:
- `SKILL.md` - Documentation with frontmatter
- Implementation script(s) - Bash or Node.js
- `package.json` - Dependencies (if Node.js)
- Symlink in `.pi/skills/` to activate

---

## File Paths

**Skills Location:** `/job/pi-skills/`  
**Active Symlinks:** `/job/.pi/skills/`  

---

## Code Lines Created

- Total lines of code: ~2,500+
- Bash scripts: ~1,200 lines
- Node.js: ~1,300 lines
- Documentation: 10 SKILL.md files
