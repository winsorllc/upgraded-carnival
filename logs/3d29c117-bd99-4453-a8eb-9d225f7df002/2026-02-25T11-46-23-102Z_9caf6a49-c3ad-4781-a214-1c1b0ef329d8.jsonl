They live in `pi-skills/<skill-name>/` and are activated by symlinking to `.pi/skills/`.\n\n## Skill structure\n\n- **`SKILL.md`** (required) — YAML frontmatter + markdown documentation\n- **Scripts** (optional) — prefer bash (.sh). Pi works primarily in bash.\n- **`package.json`** (optional) — only if Node.js dependencies are truly needed\n\n## SKILL.md format\n\nThe `description` from frontmatter appears in the event handler's system prompt under \"Active skills.\"\nThe `{baseDir}` placeholder is replaced at runtime with the skill's actual directory path.\n\n```\n---\nname: skill-name-in-kebab-case\ndescription: One sentence describing what the skill does and when to use it.\n---\n\n# Skill Name\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n{baseDir}/script.sh <args>\n```\n```\n\n## Example: Simple bash skill (most common pattern)\n\nThe built-in `transcribe` skill — a SKILL.md and a single bash script:\n\n**pi-skills/transcribe/SKILL.md:**\n```\n---\nname: transcribe\ndescription: Speech-to-text transcription using Groq Whisper API. Supports m4a, mp3, wav, ogg, flac, webm.\n---\n\n# Transcribe\n\nSpeech-to-text using Groq Whisper API.\n\n## Setup\nRequires GROQ_API_KEY environment variable.\n\n## Usage\n```bash\n{baseDir}/transcribe.sh <audio-file>\n```\n```\n\n**pi-skills/transcribe/transcribe.sh:**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then echo \"Usage: transcribe.sh <audio-file>\"; exit 1; fi\nif [ -z \"$GROQ_API_KEY\" ]; then echo \"Error: GROQ_API_KEY not set\"; exit 1; fi\ncurl -s -X POST \"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY\" \\\n  -F \"file=@${1}\" \\\n  -F \"model=whisper-large-v3-turbo\" \\\n  -F \"response_format=text\"\n```\n\n## Example: Skill with Node.js dependencies\n\nThe built-in `brave-search` skill uses Node.js for HTML parsing (jsdom, readability, turndown). It has a `package.json` and `.js` scripts. Pi runs `npm install` in the skill directory automatically. Use this pattern only when bash + curl isn't sufficient.\n\n## Activation\n\nAfter creating skill files, symlink to activate:\n```bash\nln -s ../../pi-skills/skill-name .pi/skills/skill-name\n```\n\n## Always build AND test in the same job\n\nTell Pi to test the skill with real input after creating it and fix any issues before committing. Don't create untested skills.\n\n## Credential setup\n\nIf a skill needs an API key, the user should set it up BEFORE the job runs:\n- `npx thepopebot set-agent-llm-secret <KEY_NAME> <value>` — creates a GitHub secret with `AGENT_LLM_` prefix, exposed as an env var in the Docker container\n- Also add to `.env` for local development\n- Keys can be rotated later with the same command\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772020003424}}
