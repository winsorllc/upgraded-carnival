LLMs are simulators—when given a detailed system description, they don't just describe it, they _simulate_ it. The `prose.md` specification describes a virtual machine with enough fidelity that a Prose Complete system reading it _becomes_ that VM. Simulation with sufficient fidelity is implementation. **You are the Prose Complete system.**\n\n## OpenClaw Runtime Mapping\n\n- **Task tool** in the upstream spec == OpenClaw `sessions_spawn`\n- **File I/O** == OpenClaw `read`/`write`\n- **Remote fetch** == OpenClaw `web_fetch` (or `exec` with curl when POST is required)\n\n## When to Activate\n\nActivate this skill when the user:\n\n- **Uses ANY `prose` command** (e.g., `prose boot`, `prose run`, `prose compile`, `prose update`, `prose help`, etc.)\n- Asks to run a `.prose` file\n- Mentions \"OpenProse\" or \"prose program\"\n- Wants to orchestrate multiple AI agents from a script\n- Has a file with `session \"...\"` or `agent name:` syntax\n- Wants to create a reusable workflow\n\n## Command Routing\n\nWhen a user invokes `prose <command>`, intelligently route based on intent:\n\n| Command                 | Action                                                        |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `prose help`            | Load `help.md`, guide user to what they need                  |\n| `prose run <file>`      | Load VM (`prose.md` + state backend), execute the program     |\n| `prose run handle/slug` | Fetch from registry, then execute (see Remote Programs below) |\n| `prose compile <file>`  | Load `compiler.md`, validate the program                      |\n| `prose update`          | Run migration (see Migration section below)                   |\n| `prose examples`        | Show or run example programs from `examples/`                 |\n| Other                   | Intelligently interpret based on context                      |\n\n### Important: Single Skill\n\nThere is only ONE skill: `open-prose`. There are NO separate skills like `prose-run`, `prose-compile`, or `prose-boot`. All `prose` commands route through this single skill.\n\n### Resolving Example References\n\n**Examples are bundled in `examples/` (same directory as this file).** When users reference examples by name (e.g., \"run the gastown example\"):\n\n1. Read `examples/` to list available files\n2. Match by partial name, keyword, or number\n3. Run with: `prose run examples/28-gas-town.prose`\n\n**Common examples by keyword:**\n| Keyword | File |\n|---------|------|\n| hello, hello world | `examples/01-hello-world.prose` |\n| gas town, gastown | `examples/28-gas-town.prose` |\n| captain, chair | `examples/29-captains-chair.prose` |\n| forge, browser | `examples/37-the-forge.prose` |\n| parallel | `examples/16-parallel-reviews.prose` |\n| pipeline | `examples/21-pipeline-operations.prose` |\n| error, retry | `examples/22-error-handling.prose` |\n\n### Remote Programs\n\nYou can run any `.prose` program from a URL or registry reference:\n\n```bash\n# Direct URL — any fetchable URL works\nprose run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openprose/prose/main/skills/open-prose/examples/48-habit-miner.prose\n\n# Registry shorthand — handle/slug resolves to p.prose.md\nprose run irl-danb/habit-miner\nprose run alice/code-review\n```\n\n**Resolution rules:**\n\n| Input                               | Resolution                             |\n| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Starts with `http://` or `https://` | Fetch directly from URL                |\n| Contains `/` but no protocol        | Resolve to `https://p.prose.md/{path}` |\n| Otherwise                           | Treat as local file path               |\n\n**Steps for remote programs:**\n\n1. Apply resolution rules above\n2. Fetch the `.prose` content\n3. Load the VM and execute as normal\n\nThis same resolution applies to `use` statements inside `.prose` files:\n\n```prose\nuse \"https://example.com/my-program.prose\"  # Direct URL\nuse \"alice/research\" as research             # Registry shorthand\n```\n\n---\n\n## File Locations\n\n**Do NOT search for OpenProse documentation files.** All skill files are co-located with this SKILL.md file:\n\n| File                       | Location                    | Purpose                                        |\n| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| `prose.md`                 | Same directory as this file | VM semantics (load to run programs)            |\n| `help.md`                  | Same directory as this file | Help, FAQs, onboarding (load for `prose help`) |\n| `state/filesystem.md`      | Same directory as this file | File-based state (default, load with VM)       |\n| `state/in-context.md`      | Same directory as this file | In-context state (on request)                  |\n| `state/sqlite.md`          | Same directory as this file | SQLite state (experimental, on request)        |\n| `state/postgres.md`        | Same directory as this file | PostgreSQL state (experimental, on request)    |\n| `compiler.md`              | Same directory as this file | Compiler/validator (load only on request)      |\n| `guidance/patterns.md`     | Same directory as this file | Best practices (load when writing .prose)      |\n| `guidance/antipatterns.md` | Same directory as this file | What to avoid (load when writing .prose)       |\n| `examples/`                | Same directory as this file | 37 example programs                            |\n\n**User workspace files** (these ARE in the user's project):\n\n| File/Directory   | Location                 | Purpose                           |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n| `.prose/.env`    | User's working directory | Config (key=value format)         |\n| `.prose/runs/`   | User's working directory | Runtime state for file-based mode |\n| `.prose/agents/` | User's working directory | Project-scoped persistent agents  |\n| `*.prose` files  | User's project           | User-created programs to execute  |\n\n**User-level files** (in user's home directory, shared across all projects):\n\n| File/Directory     | Location        | Purpose                                       |\n| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| `~/.prose/agents/` | User's home dir | User-scoped persistent agents (cross-project) |\n\nWhen you need to read `prose.md` or `compiler.md`, read them from the same directory where you found this SKILL.md file.

This is the recommended mode for most programs.\n\n**Switching modes:** If the user says \"use in-context state\" or passes `--in-context`, load `state/in-context.md` instead.\n\n**Experimental SQLite mode:** If the user passes `--state=sqlite` or says \"use sqlite state\", load `state/sqlite.md`. This mode requires `sqlite3` CLI to be installed (pre-installed on macOS, available via package managers on Linux/Windows). If `sqlite3` is unavailable, warn the user and fall back to filesystem state.\n\n**Experimental PostgreSQL mode:** If the user passes `--state=postgres` or says \"use postgres state\":\n\n**⚠️ Security Note:** Database credentials in `OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL` are passed to subagent sessions and visible in logs. Advise users to use a dedicated database with limited-privilege credentials. See `state/postgres.md` for secure setup guidance.\n\n1. **Check for connection configuration first:**\n\n   ```bash\n   # Check .prose/.env for OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL\n   cat .prose/.env 2>/dev/null | grep OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL\n   # Or check environment variable\n   echo $OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL\n   ```\n\n2. **If connection string exists, verify connectivity:**\n\n   ```bash\n   psql \"$OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL\" -c \"SELECT 1\" 2>&1\n   ```\n\n3. **If not configured or connection fails, advise the user:**\n\n   ```\n   ⚠️  PostgreSQL state requires a connection URL.\n\n   To configure:\n   1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (Docker, local, or cloud)\n   2. Add connection string to .prose/.env:\n\n      echo \"OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/prose\" >> .prose/.env\n\n   Quick Docker setup:\n      docker run -d --name prose-pg -e POSTGRES_DB=prose -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 5432:5432 postgres:16\n      echo \"OPENPROSE_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/prose\" >> .prose/.env\n\n   See state/postgres.md for detailed setup options.\n   ```\n\n4. **Only after successful connection check, load `state/postgres.md`**\n\nThis mode requires both `psql` CLI and a running PostgreSQL server. If either is unavailable, warn and offer fallback to filesystem state.\n\n**Context warning:** `compiler.md` is large. Only load it when the user explicitly requests compilation or validation. After compiling, recommend `/compact` or a new session before running—don't keep both docs in context.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe `examples/` directory contains 37 example programs:\n\n- **01-08**: Basics (hello world, research, code review, debugging)\n- **09-12**: Agents and skills\n- **13-15**: Variables and composition\n- **16-19**: Parallel execution\n- **20-21**: Loops and pipelines\n- **22-23**: Error handling\n- **24-27**: Advanced (choice, conditionals, blocks, interpolation)\n- **28**: Gas Town (multi-agent orchestration)\n- **29-31**: Captain's chair pattern (persistent orchestrator)\n- **33-36**: Production workflows (PR auto-fix, content pipeline, feature factory, bug hunter)\n- **37**: The Forge (build a browser from scratch)\n\nStart with `01-hello-world.prose` or try `37-the-forge.prose` to watch AI build a web browser.\n\n## Execution\n\nWhen first invoking the OpenProse VM in a session, display this banner:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         ◇ OpenProse VM ◇            │\n│       A new kind of computer        │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nTo execute a `.prose` file, you become the OpenProse VM:\n\n1. **Read `prose.md`** — this document defines how you embody the VM\n2. **You ARE the VM** — your conversation is its memory, your tools are its instructions\n3. **Spawn sessions** — each `session` statement triggers a Task tool call\n4. **Narrate state** — use the narration protocol to track execution ([Position], [Binding], [Success], etc.)\n5. **Evaluate intelligently** — `**...**` markers require your judgment\n\n## Help & FAQs\n\nFor syntax reference, FAQs, and getting started guidance, load `help.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Migration (`prose update`)\n\nWhen a user invokes `prose update`, check for legacy file structures and migrate them to the current format.\n\n### Legacy Paths to Check\n\n| Legacy Path         | Current Path   | Notes                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `.prose/state.json` | `.prose/.env`  | Convert JSON to key=value format |\n| `.prose/execution/` | `.prose/runs/` | Rename directory                 |\n\n### Migration Steps\n\n1. **Check for `.prose/state.json`**\n   - If exists, read the JSON content\n   - Convert to `.env` format:\n     ```json\n     { \"OPENPROSE_TELEMETRY\": \"enabled\", \"USER_ID\": \"user-xxx\", \"SESSION_ID\": \"sess-xxx\" }\n     ```\n     becomes:\n     ```env\n     OPENPROSE_TELEMETRY=enabled\n     USER_ID=user-xxx\n     SESSION_ID=sess-xxx\n     ```\n   - Write to `.prose/.env`\n   - Delete `.prose/state.json`\n\n2. **Check for `.prose/execution/`**\n   - If exists, rename to `.prose/runs/`\n   - The internal structure of run directories may also have changed; migration of individual run state is best-effort\n\n3. **Create `.prose/agents/` if missing**\n   - This is a new directory for project-scoped persistent agents\n\n### Migration Output\n\n```\n🔄 Migrating OpenProse workspace...\n  ✓ Converted .prose/state.json → .prose/.env\n  ✓ Renamed .prose/execution/ → .prose/runs/\n  ✓ Created .prose/agents/\n✅ Migration complete. Your workspace is up to date.\n```\n\nIf no legacy files are found:\n\n```\n✅ Workspace already up to date.
