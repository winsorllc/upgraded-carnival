Based on ZeroClaw's SkillForge architecture.\n---\n\n# Skill Discovery (SkillForge)\n\nAutomatically discovers, evaluates, and generates integration manifests for new PopeBot-compatible skills from GitHub repositories.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill implements a simplified version of ZeroClaw's SkillForge system. It:\n1. **Scouts** GitHub for skill-related repositories\n2. **Evaluates** candidates across multiple dimensions (compatibility, quality, security)\n3. **Generates** PopeBot-compatible SKILL.md manifests for qualified candidates\n\n## Usage\n\n### Discover Skills\n\n```bash\n# Basic discovery (searches for \"thepopebot skill\" and \"ai agent skill\")\n{baseDir}/discover.js\n\n# Search with custom queries\n{baseDir}/discover.js --query \"popebot automation\"\n\n# Show detailed output\n{baseDir}/discover.js --verbose\n\n# Limit results\n{baseDir}/discover.js --limit 10\n```\n\n### Evaluate a Specific Repository\n\n```bash\n# Evaluate a single repo by URL\n{baseDir}/evaluate.js https://github.com/user/repo-name\n\n# Evaluate with custom scoring weights\n{baseDir}/evaluate.js https://github.com/user/repo-name --min-score 0.6\n```\n\n### Generate Skill Manifest\n\n```bash\n# Generate SKILL.md from a evaluated candidate\n{baseDir}/generate.js --name \"skill-name\" --url \"https://github.com/user/repo\" --description \"What it does\"\n```\n\n## Scoring Dimensions\n\nSkills are evaluated on three dimensions (each 0.0-1.0):\n\n| Dimension | Weight | Factors |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n| **Compatibility** | 30% | Language (JavaScript/TypeScript favored), runtime requirements |\n| **Quality** | 35% | Star count (log scale), documentation, test coverage |\n| **Security** | 35% | License presence, bad pattern detection, update recency |\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Auto** (score ≥ 0.7): Safe to auto-integrate\n- **Manual** (0.4 ≤ score < 0.7): Needs human review\n- **Skip** (score < 0.4): Not recommended\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\n=== SkillForge Discovery Report ===\nDiscovered: 5 candidates\nEvaluated: 5 candidates\nAuto-integratable: 2\nManual review: 2\nSkipped: 1\n\n--- Candidates ---\n\n1. example-skill ⭐ AUTO (0.82)\n   URL: https://github.com/user/example-skill\n   Language: JavaScript | Stars: 156 | License: MIT\n   Scores: Compatibility=1.0, Quality=0.72, Security=0.8\n\n2. another-skill ⚠️ MANUAL (0.55)\n   URL: https://github.com/user/another-skill\n   Language: Python | Stars: 23 | License: None\n   Scores: Compatibility=0.6, Quality=0.45, Security=0.5\n\n3. low-quality ⛔ SKIP (0.28)\n   URL: https://github.com/user/low-quality\n   Language: Unknown | Stars: 1 | License: None\n   Scores: Compatibility=0.2, Quality=0.15, Security=0.3\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ncd {baseDir}\nnpm install\n```\n\n## When to Use\n\n- When you want to find new skills for PopeBot\n- When exploring the skill ecosystem\n- When you need to evaluate a skill before integrating\n- When building automated skill management workflows\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Discover new skills\n{baseDir}/discover.js --limit 20 --verbose > /job/tmp/skill-candidates.md\n\n# 2. Review the report\ncat /job/tmp/skill-candidates.md\n\n# 3. Evaluate a promising candidate in detail\n{baseDir}/evaluate.js https://github.com/user/promising-skill\n\n# 4. Generate integration manifest for approved skills\n{baseDir}/generate.js --name \"promising-skill\" \\\n  --url \"https://github.com/user/promising-skill\" \\\n  --description \"Does something useful\"\n\n# 5. Move generated manifest to pi-skills/ and create symlink\nmv /job/tmp/skills/promising-skill/SKILL.md /job/pi-skills/promising-skill/\nln -s ../../pi-skills/promising-skill /job/.pi/skills/promising-skill\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSet these environment variables for customization:\n\n- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Personal access token for higher API rate limits\n- `SKILLFORGE_MIN_SCORE` - Minimum score for auto recommendation (default: 0.7)\n- `SKILLFORGE_OUTPUT_DIR` - Output directory for generated manifests (default: /job/tmp/skills)\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- Skills containing bad patterns (malware, exploit, etc.) are automatically flagged\n- Missing licenses reduce security scores significantly\n- Repositories not updated in 180+ days receive recency penalties\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1772023903646}}
